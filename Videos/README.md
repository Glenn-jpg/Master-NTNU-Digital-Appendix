#Data Generation
In Visual demo of data data set generation of NURBS geometry and Visual demo of data data set generation of NURBS geometry - 2
two examples are shown that illustrate the data generation process done in Grasshopper in combination with Python.
For these specific examples the NURBS approach is used to establish the geometry.
