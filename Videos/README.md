### These videoes demonstrate how data generation and the different components in our thesis work

# Data Generation

### Visual demo of data data set generation of NURBS geometry 
An example showing how the gridshells are randomly generated in grasshopper
### Visual demo of data data set generation of NURBS geometry - 2
Another example showing how the gridshells are randomly generated in grasshopper
